# OASIS - Shooting Simulator

OASIS (Optimal Accuracy Simulator In Simulations) is an immersive shooting simulator built using the CHAI3D framework. This project aims to provide a realistic and interactive shooting experience with haptic feedback.

## Features

- Multiple weapon types: M1911 Pistol, AK47 Rifle, and Dragunov Sniper Rifle
- Realistic weapon handling and recoil simulation
- Haptic feedback for enhanced immersion
- Dynamic target system
- Time trial mode for skill assessment
- 3D environment with obstacle blocks
- Customizable lighting effects

## Requirements

- CHAI3D library
- OpenGL and GLUT
- C++ compiler with C++11 support

## Building and Running

1. Ensure you have the CHAI3D library installed and properly configured in your development environment.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AKadmani/Haptic-Recoil.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory and build the project using your preferred C++ build system (e.g., CMake, Make).
4. Run the compiled executable.

## Controls

- `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`: Move the camera
- `Q`, `E`: Rotate the weapon
- Mouse movement: Aim
- Left mouse button: Fire weapon
- `1`, `2`, `3`: Switch between weapons (Pistol, Rifle, Sniper)
- `T`: Start time trial mode
- `X`: Exit the application
